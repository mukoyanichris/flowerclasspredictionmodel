# flowerclasspredictionmodel
This repository contains a pre-trained machine learning model for classifying flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model was trained using a Deep Neural Network (DNN), and it can be used to predict the species of a flower based on its features.

##Model Details
Model Type: Deep Neural Network (DNN)
Input Features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Target Variable: Species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Training Data: Iris dataset, containing 150 examples of flowers with labeled species. Source: Iris Dataset
Accuracy: [Add performance metrics like accuracy or F1 score if applicable]

##Requirements
To use the model, you will need the following Python libraries:
bash
Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt
